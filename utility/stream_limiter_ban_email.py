Share functions from https://gist.github.com/JonnyWong16/f8139216e2748cb367558070c1448636

Once user stream count hits LIMIT they are unshared from libraries expect for banned library.
Once user stream count is below LIMIT and banned library video is watched their shares are restored.
Once violation count have been reached ban permanently.

Caveats:
    Unsharing doesn't pause the stream.
    After unsharing user can pause but not skip ahead or skip back.
    Going from unshared to shared while playing still kills the connection to the server.
    Effected user will need to refresh browser/app or restart app to reconnect.
    User watch record stop when unshare is executed.
    If user finishes a movie/show while unshared they will not have that record.
    Tautulli will not have that record.

Adding to Tautulli

Tautulli > Settings > Notification Agents > Scripts > Bell icon:
        [X] Notify on playback start
        [X] Notify on watched

Tautulli > Settings > Notification Agents > Scripts > Gear icon:
        Playback Start: stream_limiter_ban_email.py
        Playback Watched: stream_limiter_ban_email.py

If used in Tautulli:
Tautulli will continue displaying that user is watching after unshare is executed in ACTIVITY.
Tautulli will update after ~5 minutes and no longer display user's stream in ACTIVITY.
Tautulli will think that user has stopped.


Create new library with one video.
Name library and video whatever you want.

My suggestion:
    Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
    Video Summary: "You have been banned for one reason or another. Please watch this video to become un-banned.
        The entire video must be watched in order to trigger un-ban."
Change Video Poster and Background.
Entire video needs to be watched to trigger normal sharing.

This is indented to restrict a user to the LIMIT amount of concurrent streams. User will be warned, punished, and
banned completely if violations continue.

Clear user history for banned video to remove violation counts and run manually to share again.

Concurrent stream count is the trigger. Trigger can be anything you want.
